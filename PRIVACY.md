# Privacy Policy for Scroll Position Saver

**Last updated:** February 2025

## Overview

Scroll Position Saver is a Chrome extension that saves and restores your scroll position on web pages. This policy describes what data the extension uses and where it is stored.

## Data collection

**We do not collect, transmit, or have access to any of your data.**

The extension does not send information to any external server or to the developer. All processing happens in your browser.

## Data storage

The extension uses Chrome’s **local storage** (`chrome.storage.local`) to store:

- **Scroll positions** – the horizontal and vertical scroll offset for each page URL you visit while the extension is enabled.

This data:

- Stays **only on your device**
- Is **not** synced to the cloud (unless you use Chrome sync for extension data, which is a Chrome setting, not under our control)
- Is **not** shared with anyone

You can delete all saved positions at any time using the “Clear all saved positions” button in the extension popup.

## Permissions

The extension requests:

- **Storage** – to save and read scroll positions locally. No data leaves your browser.

It does **not** request access to your browsing history, personal information, or any data beyond what is needed for saving scroll position per URL.

## Third parties

The extension does not use analytics, ads, or third-party scripts. No third party receives any data from the extension.

## Changes

If this privacy policy is updated, the change will be reflected in this document and the “Last updated” date will be revised. For the Chrome extension, significant policy changes will be reflected in the Chrome Web Store listing as required by Google’s policies.
